                    My name is Niko Raipia and I'm a 29 year old man from Finland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first started using computers when I was 4 years old and I 
                    immediately knew that computers would play a big role in my life and 
                    I was right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first got into coding after I started hosting private servers for different games
                     that I liked. Every time I hosted a new server I had to 
                     create a web page that would show patch notes of all the changes I made, restart schedule, 
                     highscores, account creation and login system to create a character into that account, 
                     forums and more depending on the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back when I hosted private servers for Tibia, I used XAMPP to host and phpMyAdmin for the control panel. 
                    MySQL database with a PHP registration.
                </p>

                    When I finally went to school here in Vaasa (Datanomi, Tradenomi - dropped out), 
                    hoping to learn new and more advanced stuff about developing for the web. 
                    Sadly, after a while I realized I already knew almost everything they taught about web developing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays I'm constantly teaching myself all kinds of different stuff, 
                    mostly to do with computers including web developement. 
                    I'm currently focusing on React and front-end developement. 
                    Open to the possibility of doing back-end or even full stack developing in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I developed this web page as a proof of consept in roughly 2 days, 
                    just for this job application to Wapice using HTML, CSS and React. 
                    It's still a work in progress and has many placeholders but should show off 
                    some of my skills and my current capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a person I am calm, calculating and tenacious.
                     I always try to optimize everything I do that can be optimized. 
                     Some of my hobbies include eSports (CS:GO, Pretty high level), 
                     cycling and training my 2 year old dog (White Shepherd).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also a very fast learner and I'm always looking for new ways to 
                    improve my overall web developement capabilities and I'm always up for a challenge.
